Stand alone computation of inverse geometry for biped robots or robotic arms.

Here inverse geometry refer to function that compute the robot joint configuration from SE3 poses of it's end-effectors. Much similar to the classical inverse kinematics though at the position level and not at the velocity level.

This code is decomposed in 3 parts:

    Leg inverse geometry.
    Arm inverse geometry.
    Biped inverse geometry. This part uses the 2 previous ones for computing the whole body inverse geometry assuming a constant level arm between the center of mass of the robot and its base.
